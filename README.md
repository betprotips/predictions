# Football Predictions with AI & Expert Analysis

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of how football match predictions can be generated by combining **AI-powered algorithms** with **expert insights**. By blending data-driven analysis with human expertise, we aim to provide predictions that are not only statistically informed but also context-aware.

Inspired by [betprotips.com](https://betprotips.com), which publishes football predictions, match previews, and in-depth statistical insights.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
   Match data is gathered via trusted football APIs. We collect detailed information including:
   - Team stats and current form  
   - Lineups and player availability  
   - Head-to-head history  
   - League standings  
   - Weather and matchday conditions  

2. **Feature Analysis**  
   Our AI models analyze key factors to identify trends, correlations, and patterns that can influence match outcomes.  

3. **Blended Approach**  
   While AI handles the quantitative side, expert analysis provides qualitative insights that raw data might miss — such as tactical adjustments, injuries, or motivational factors.

## Prediction Outputs

From this process, we generate four main types of predictions for each match:

1. **Predicted Winner** – The team most likely to win the match.  
2. **Both Teams to Score (BTTS)** – Predicting whether both teams are expected to score.  
3. **Over/Under Goals** – Forecasting the total number of goals in a match.  
4. **Predicted Goalscorer** – Highlighting players most likely to score.  

These predictions provide a rounded view of the match outcome and key events, combining both statistical analysis and expert insights.
